## Description of Changes

  Reorganized the codebase into separate modules, where each module focuses on a specific functionality or feature.
  Each module resides in its own directory, containing the necessary files and resources related to that module.
  
## Reasons for Changes

  The goal was to improve code maintainability, reusability, and readability by breaking down our application into smaller, modular pieces.

## Additional Information

  The modular architecture provides a solid foundation for future expansions and ensures a more organized development process. It also fosters collaboration among developers, as they can work independently on different modules without interfering with each other's code. As a result, our application becomes more scalable and adaptable to changes, offering a better experience for both developers and end-users.
